The bottom line to simplify is that everything goes up - the file

safe pull does not need any authentication
safe push requires you to be authenticated


Maybe safe pull will create a subdirectory in .safedb.net and then writes into a config (say json) file in ~/.safedb.net the directory name.
Maybe safe switch changes the safe database folder by writing that config file




Simplify the Safe

 - safe pull https://github.com..../repo-name?branch-or-commit-name
 - pull backs up the current directory into ~/.safe-backups

 - safe push (will send wherever the pull came from)
 - or safe push (from a verse uses the config in the verse to do the push
