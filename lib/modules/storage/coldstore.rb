    # Cold storage can sync repositories with a <b>bias during conflicts</b>
    # either to the <em>remote repository</em> <b>when pulling</b>, and then
    # conversely to the <em>local reposiory</em> <b>when pushing</b>.
    #
    # In between the sync operations a ColdStore can create, read, update and
    # delete to and from the local mirror.
    #
    # == ColdStore | Use Cases
    #
    # Any <b>self-respecting coldstore</b> must, after initialization, provide
    # some basic (and mandatory) behaviour.
    #
    # These include
    #
    # - <b>read</b> - reading text from a (possibly unavailable) frozen path
    # - <b>write</b> - writing text (effectively freezing it) to a path
    # - <b>pull</b> - sync with a <b>collision bias</b> that favours the remote mirror 
    # - <b>push</b> - sync with a <b>collision bias</b> that favours the local mirror
    #
    # <b>Cold Storage</b> is borrowed from BitCoin and represents offline storage
    # for keys and crypts. safe separates keys and crypts so that you can
    # transfer and share secrets by moving keys (not the crypts).
    #
    # == Houses and Gold Bullion
    #
    # You don't carry houses or gold bullion around to rent, share or transfer
    # their ownership.
    #
    # You copy keys to rent secrets and when the tenure is up (or you change your
    # mind) you revoke access with a metaphorical lock change.
    #
    # safe embodies concepts like an owner who rents as opposed to a change
    # in ownership.
    #
    # == trade secrets | commoditizing secrets
    #
    # safe is a conduit through which secrets can be bought and sold.
    #
    # It commoditizes secrets so that they can be owned, traded, leased and
    # auctioned. Options to acquire or relinquish them at set prices can easily
    # be taken out.

      # @param base_path [String]
      #    path to the store's (mirror) base directory.

      #    the domain is an identifier (and namespace) denoting which safe
      #    "account" is being accessed. safe allows the creation and use of
      #    multiple domains.
