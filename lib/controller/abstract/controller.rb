module SafeDb

  # The parent SafeDb use case is designed to be extended by the cli
  # (command line) use cases like {SafeDb::Open}, {SafeDb::Put} and
  # {SafeDb::Lock} because it describes behaviour common to at least two
  # (but usually more) of the use cases.
  #
  # == Common Use Case Behaviour
  #
  # This {SafeDb::Controller} use case is designed to be extended and does preparatory
  # work to create favourable and useful conditions to make use cases readable,
  # less repetitive, simpler and concise.
  #
  # == Machine (Workstation) Configuration File
  #
  # The global configuration filepath is found off the home directory using {Dir.home}.
  #
  #    ~/.safedb.net/safedb.net.configuration.ini
  #
  # The global configuration file in INI format is managed through the methods
  #
  # - {grab} read the value at key_name from the default section
  # - {stash} put directive key/value pair in default section
  # - {read} read the value at key_name from the parameter section
  # - {write} put directive key/value pair in parameter section

    # - checking for (and reporting a lack of) the safe token environment variable
    # - asimilating a fact file if employed by the specific use case (controller)
